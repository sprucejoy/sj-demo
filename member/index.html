Let’s assume a website:

Without digital subscription:
100,000 unique visitor per month
2 pages per visit
$20 RPM from ads
Ad revenue = 100,000 x 2 / 1,000 x $20 = $4,000.
With digital subscription:
Install SpruceJoy subscription service on your website, so your plan includes
No-ad experience for subscribers.
Subscriber-only content.
And more benefits…
$5 subscription plan per month
1% conversion rate
Subscription revenue = 100,000 x 1% x $5 = $5,000
Ad revenue = 100,000 x (1-1%) x 2 / 1,000 x $20 = $3,960
Total revenue = subscription + ad revenue = $8,960
Results:
1% Super fans = 124% revenue increase.
